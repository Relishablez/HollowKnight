## 🚀 How to Contribute

1. **Fork this repository**  
   - Click the **Fork** button (top-right) to create your own copy of the repo.

2. **Create a branch**  
   - When editing a file on GitHub, choose **“Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.”**  
   - Give the branch a short, clear name (e.g. `fix-typo`, `improve-ui`).

3. **Make your changes**  
   - Edit files directly in GitHub’s editor, or upload new ones into the right folder.  
   - Keep changes small and focused (one feature or fix per pull request).

4. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**  
   - After saving your edits, GitHub will guide you to open a PR.  
   - Add a short title and description of what you changed.  
   - Submit your PR and wait for review.
